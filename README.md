To predict the volume of bike rentals on an hourly basis we have some data about the season, weather, and day of the week. Machine learning models make mistakes. We trained a model on data using Random forest regression method and also wanted to train model which can predict error on original modal mistakes and can improvise itself, based on learnings how the model did in the past. The performance of the trained model looked acceptable in training, so we decided to give it a go. We assume that we only learn the ground truth (the actual demand) at the end. Since the actuals are available only once per week, we decide to run a regular model analysis every time (as per our assumption). Also to improve the prediction quality, a data centric approach is tried. And the obtained results will be reviewed and by keeping modal unchanged. So that modal life cycle can be monitor or when it breaks, which had been observed by R2, RMSE, MAPE, etc. and different plots. At sudo deployment (as per our assumptions) period from the beginning (training of model) till the last week (4th week) of model breakdown, there is nearly 29.5% decremented change in R2 score and nearly 50% incremental change in RMSE values. Now we retrain the modal often until it learn all the patterns. Before it breaks we also got some data and prediction drifts. Error behavior also observed throughout model lifecycle. We only learn the ground truth (the actual demand) at the end of each week.
